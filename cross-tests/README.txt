The script `redex-model-implies-agda-model.rkt` contains a number of
redex model-based esterel expressions that each get their own file in
the scratch/ directory (each one supplied in a call to `test-p`).

Each of those files contains the agda code for each of the possible
reductions that the corresponding expression can reduce to, according
to redex. The script then typechecks the file, checking that it
reduces the same way in the agda model. It also contains a test
that Can matches and that CorrectBinding is the same in both models.

The scratch/ directory is left intact from any previous run; any file
not generated by the current run is ignored, but the current run
may overwrite files already in the scratch/ directory.

Run

 % racket redex-model-implies-agda-model.rkt

to run a basic set of tests. Pass `-r` to run random tests (use `-h`
to see all of the flags)
