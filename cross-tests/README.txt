The script `redex-model-implies-agda-model.rkt` contains a number of
redex model-based esterel expressions that each get their own file in
the `scratch/` directory (each one supplied in a call to `test-p`).

The files beginning with `send-` implement conversions between the
various constructs in redex and in agda. The `calculus-examples` is
part of the infrastructure that the paper's build process uses to
verify that the examples (which are typeset by redex) are correct in
agda.

Each of the files in `scratch/` contains the agda code for each of the
possible reductions that the corresponding expression can reduce to,
according to redex. The script then typechecks the file, which checks
that the term reduces the same way in the agda model. It also contains
a test that Can and CorrectBinding are the same in both models.

The `scratch/` directory is left intact from any previous run; any
file not generated by the current run is ignored, but the current run
may overwrite files already in the `scratch/` directory.

Run

 % racket redex-model-implies-agda-model.rkt

to run a basic set of tests. Pass `-r` to run random tests (use `-h`
to see all of the flags)
