@title[#:tag "sec:examples"]{What the Calculus Can and Cannot Prove}

Our semantics lends itself to establishing
equivalences between program fragments because
any two expressions that are @es[‚â°e] to each other
always produce the same result in the evaluator:

@theorem[#:label "thm:equivimplieseval" #:break? #t]{
@(equiv
  (list (var-prem p)
        (var-prem Œ∏_1)
        (var-prem ùïä_1)
        (var-prem q)
        (var-prem Œ∏_2)
        (var-prem ùïä_2))
  (list (newline-prem)
        (fact-prem (CB (œÅ Œ∏_1 p)))
        (newline-prem)
        (fact-prem (‚â°e () () () (œÅ Œ∏_1 p) (œÅ Œ∏_2 q)))
        (newline-prem)
        (fact-prem (Eval () () () p Œ∏_1 ùïä_1))
        (newline-prem)
        (fact-prem (Eval () () () q Œ∏_2 ùïä_2))
        (newline-prem))
  (same ùïä_1 ùïä_2)
  "‚â°‚Çë=>eval")
 }
This theorem is a straightforward consequence of @es[‚â°e]
being consistent; the proof is given as @tt{‚â°@|sub-e|=>eval}
in the Agda code in the supplementary material.

The remainder of this section explores various equivalences
(shown in @figure-ref["fig:equivalences"])
as well as some limitations of the calculus. The proofs of
the equivalences
are all given in @tt{calculus-examples.agda} in the
supplementary material.

The first example, @theorem-ref["thm:one"], shows that we can rearrange signal forms.
This example works well in our calculus. It requires only that
the body expression has correct binding, allowing us to
rearrange adjacent @es[signal] forms arbitrarily.

Next, @theorem-ref["thm:two"] shows that if an @es[emit] is followed by a
@es[present], the @es[present] can always be replaced by
the taken branch.
This example exposes a first limitation of the calculus.
Although it is still true, our calculus cannot prove this
equivalence without the @es[signal] form being visible in an
evaluation context surrounding the @es[seq] form.

In a dual to @theorem-ref["thm:two"], @theorem-ref["thm:three"] shows that
if we know that neither branch of the
@es[present] expression can emit @es[S], we can replace
the @es[present] form with its second subexpression.

@Theorem-ref["thm:four"] lets us lift a @es[seq] expression that starts
with an @es[emit] out of a @es[par] branch. Intuitively,
this equivalence is a consequence of Esterel's deterministic
parallelism. Because @es[emit] does not block, we can do it
in parallel to @es[q] or before @es[q] starts, whichever
is more convenient.

When a @es[trap] is outside a @es[par], our calculus
allows us to push the @es[trap] inside,
in some situations. @Theorem-ref["thm:five"] is one such.
This calculation requires @es[p] to be equivalent
to some @es[done] expression @es[q], but that is a weakness
of our calculus. In fact, the two expressions are observably
equivalent without any assumptions.

@Theorem-ref["thm:six"] further generalizes @Theorem-ref["thm:one"]
to rearrange binding forms across other expressions.
In this example, the @es[signal] form is pulled out of
the @es[seq] expression. In general, these
two expressions are observably equivalent even without
the @es[œÅ] expression outside. Our
calculus cannot prove it, however, because the calculus needs an outer
@es[œÅ] expression in order to perform a @rule["merge"] in
the middle of the proof.

We explored a calculus that includes a ‚Äúlifting‚Äù rule that
allows us to move a @es[œÅ] term up and down in an evaluation
context. This rule makes it difficult to establish
confluence of the calculus, however, as the would-be lifting
rule and the @rule["merge"] rule interact with each other in
complex ways. In particular, our evaluation contexts do not
have unique decomposition, due to @es[par]. Accordingly, a
use of the lifting rule from one side of a @es[par] expression
can block a use of the @rule["merge"] rule from the other side.
We conjecture that a lifting rule would be confluent, but have
not proven it.
If we did have such a rule, then we believe we would be able to prove
@theorem-ref["thm:six"] without the need for an enclosing
empty @es[œÅ] expression and even be able to relax one of the assumptions of
@theorem-ref["thm:five"], assuming only that @es[q] is @es[complete].

Our calculus also cannot reason effectively with expressions
that span multiple instants. For example, the expression
@es[(seq (loop pause) q)] is equivalent to
@es[(loop pause)], but our calculus cannot prove it.
Similarly, a common pattern is to emit a signal and pause in
a loop, and also to run that loop in parallel with some code that looks
at the signal. Our calculus would not be able to propagate
the signal's presence because of the @es[pause].

Another deep lack in our calculus is the ability to reason
about input signals. In order for our calculus to work with
a signal, it must be bound by @es[signal] so knowledge about
it can be manipulated via the rules for @es[œÅ] expressions.
Input signals, in contrast, might or might not be set by the
environment and our calculus cannot perform the required
conditional reasoning.
