@title{Introduction}

The language Esterel has found success in many safety critical
applications. It
has been used in the creation and verification of the maintenance
and test computer, landing gear control computer, and
virtual display systems of civilian and
military aircraft at Dassault
Aviation@~cite[esterel-avionics]; the
control software of the N4 nuclear power plants; the
Airbus A320 fly-by-wire system; and the specification of part of Texas Instrument's digital signal
processors@~cite[twelve-years-later].

This success with real time and embedded systems in domains
that need strong guarantees can be partially attributed to
its computational model. Esterel treats
computation as a series of deterministic reactions to
external stimuli. All parts of a reaction complete
in a single, discrete time step, called an @italic{instant}.
Furthermore, in this synchronous reactive
paradigm@~cite[synchronous-approach twelve-years-later],
each instant is isolated from interference by
the outside environment once the reaction begins. In
addition, instants exhibit deterministic concurrency; 
each reaction may contain concurrent
threads without execution order effecting the
result of the computation.

This combination of synchronous reactions with
deterministic concurrency makes formulating the semantics a challenging problem.
Existing semantics tend to take two
forms. The first, and most widely used, are denotational
semantics that give meaning to programs through a
translation to circuits. These semantics are excellent for
compilation and optimization. However they are
not ideal for programmers, who would rather reason in terms
of a program rather than its compilation.

The second form are operational semantics that eschew term
rewriting in favor of decorating terms with various flavors
of code pointers and state annotations to track execution.
These semantics are easier for programmers to reason with
but only give meaning to whole programs. They do not
lend themselves to compositional reasoning about
program fragments, which programmers need.

To obtain the best of both of these approaches, we build on @citet[plotkin] and @citet[felleisen-hieb]â€™s work on equational theories of programming languages.
These theories model languages with a set of axioms that specify
when source-level terms are equivalent. As a result, they provide a single
framework for both reasoning about how a program will run (e.g.
reduce to an answer) using only the source text of the
program, and for justifying program transformations in host
of applications: compiler transformations, refactorings,
program derivations, etc.

This paper reports on the first equational theory of
Esterel. Developing such a theory is tricky because of the
highly non-local nature of evaluation in Esterel. To
maintain determinism and synchrony, evaluation in one thread of execution
may affect code arbitrarily far away away in the program,
even if that evaluation does not directly modify shared state.
For instance, the selection of a
particular branch of execution in one thread may immediately
unblock a different thread of execution. The selection of
the other branch may render the entire program invalid. These non-local execution and correctness issues are at the
heart of the notions of @italic{Logical Correctness} and
@italic{Constructiveness}, and have informed the choice of
techniques used for previous semantics. The circuit
semantics match both notions well because they are
intimately tied to whether or not a given cyclic circuit
settles. The operational semantics handle these properties
by performing full program passes on each evaluation step to
both propagate execution information to the entire program,
and determine which locations in the program are safe to
evaluate. A calculus, however, cannot use either of those techniques. To this end our calculus borrows from
@citet[felleisen-hieb]'s equational theory of state and
@citet[optimizations-for-esterel-programs]'s Constructive
Operational Semantics to give the first calculus for Esterel.

The remainder of this paper consists of ten sections.
@Secref["sec:gentle"] provides an introduction to Esterel
and to the specific syntax we use for Kernel Esterel.
@Secref["sec:reduction"] shows the basic notion of reduction
that our calculus supports and @secref["sec:can"] describes
our potential function, a metafunction that provides an
element of the semantics essential to synchrony. Our semantics has an
invariant that captures how variables are to be used in
Esterel programs that is described in @secref["sec:cb"] and
@secref["sec:eval"] gives the @es[Eval] function and the
central result of this work, namely that @es[Eval] is consistent.

With the semantics defined, the paper moves on to discuss
implications of specific aspects of our semantics.
@Secref["sec:constructiveness"] discusses constructiveness
and how it interacts with our semantics.
@Secref["sec:examples"] gives some example equivalences that
our calculus supports and discusses others that it does not.
Our semantics is executable and @secref["sec:testing"]
discusses how we test that our semantics is faithful to
preexisting semantics and implementations. The executable
nature of our semantics also enabled us to find bugs in the
implementations, which is also discussed in
@secref["sec:testing"]. @Secref["sec:stdred"] discusses
the standard reduction and we conclude with a discussion of
related work in @secref["sec:related"].

@title{Introduction}

Synchronous reactive languages@~cite[synchronous-approach twelve-years-later]
express computation as a sequence of synchronous reactions.
That is, in these programming languages, time is explicit
and it advances in discrete steps, one @italic{instant} at a time. Each instant is
deterministic, and takes a bounded amount of time. These
languages combine synchronous reactions (one per instant) with
deterministic concurrency. This makes them ideal for real
time and embedded computations.

In Esterel, programs interact with the external world via signals
that reflect the outside world (via sensors, data feeds, etc.). During
each instant, the program makes decisions based on the signals and
decisions propagate throughout the program in
effectively zero time. These decisions are irrevocable, so
no part of the program can observe its
environment---including both the external world and other
parts of the program---in a state where some decision has
not yet been made. This deterministic decision-making also makes Esterel well suited
to event-driven domains that need strong guarantees about
the language's behavior, such as avionics software@~cite[esterel-avionics].

Semantics for Esterel usually take one of two forms:
operational semantics that evaluate whole programs
or denotational semantics that express
program behavior in terms of circuits.

In contrast to these existing Esterel semantics stand
equational theories, such as @citet[felleisen-hieb]'s theory
of state. Such theories model languages with
a relation between equivalent terms, rewriting
programs at the source level. Reasoning about programs via
reduction enables reasoning
about program fragments rather than full programs. These equational theories give a unified 
framework for reasoning about how a program will
run (e.g. reduce to an answer) using only the source text of the program, and for justifying
program transformations in host of applications: compiler
transformations, refactorings, program derivations, etc.

This paper presents the first equational theory of Kernel
Esterel@~cite[esterel02]. Such a theory is complex because
equational rewrites in one part of the program can affect
other, remote parts of the program. For example, choosing a branch in one
sub-expression may cause another, textually unrelated
sub-expression to compute.
