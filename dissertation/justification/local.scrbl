@title[#:style paper-title-style #:tag "just:local"]{Justifying Local}

Justifying that the calculus allows for local reasoning is
not difficult. The relation @es[â‰¡] contains a context rule
which states that the the rules of the calculus apply in any
program context. I would argue that this is the definition
of locality in terms of calculi.
