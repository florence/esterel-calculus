This directory contains the Agda proofs about the Esterel Calculus.


The proof structure for the proof of consistency works as follows:

Define the caluclus.
  (`calculus.agda`)
Break the calculus into two parts, one containing only [par-swap], and one without it.
  (`sn-calculus.agda` and `par-swap.agda`)
prove that this the second part is strongly normalizing.
  (`sn-calculus-compatconf.agda` and `sn-calculus-confluence.agda`)
prove that this second part is locally confluent.
  (`noetherian.agda`)
prove by Newmans lemma that the it is confluent.
  (`sn-calculus-props.agda`)
prove that the [par-swap] part is confluent.
  (`par-swap/confluent.agda`)
prove by hindley-rossen that the union of the two is confluent.
  (`par-swap/union-confluent.agda`)
prove that the union is equivent to the formulation in `calculus.agda.`
  (`eval-props.agda`)
define the evaluator induced by the reduction relation.
  (`eval.agda`)
prove that the induced evaulator is consistent given confluence of the reduction relation.
  (`eval-props.agda`)
